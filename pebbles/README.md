PebbleScript Interpreter Binary
===============================

To run .peb scripts from the shell. Pebbles does currently link against
'libdl' and does only run on systems that provide this dynamic linking
library (Linux, Unix).

PebbleScript itself however should run happily everywhere the STL is
available.
